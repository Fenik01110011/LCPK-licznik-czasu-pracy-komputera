# LCPK-licznik-czasu-pracy-komputera
My first program. LCPK ("computer hour meter") is a program that counts the time spent on the computer. It starts when you start your computer and runs in the background. A program can be set to be hard to detect by a user who doesn't know about it. It can be used to check how much time is spent in front of the computer and, for example, to control the time children spend in front of the computer. The program creates a list of activities, so you can later see when the computer was turned on. It is possible to delete the activity history, but this option is protected with a password, if previously set. The password can be changed at any time. The program has the ability to adjust the displayed data by selecting an appropriate option in the menu. Using the program "Disabling_mode_ninja.exe" you can restore the normal display of the program, so you can find its icon in the tray. This program was written in "C ++ Builder 6"
